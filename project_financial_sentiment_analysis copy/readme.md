## Project Report: Financial Sentiment Analyzer

## 1. Project Overview-
This project is an advanced Market Anomaly Detection System developed in Python, designed to identify and analyze unusual events within financial time series data. It integrates a range of statistical and machine learning methodologies to provide a comprehensive view of market anomalies. The system's core component is the MarketAnomalyDetector class, which implements five distinct detection algorithms: Statistical Process Control (Z-Score), Volatility Clustering, Jump-Diffusion, Isolation Forest, and Regime Change Detection. The project is deployed as a user-friendly Streamlit application, allowing users to interactively analyze market data for any specified stock ticker and date range. This system is a powerful tool for risk management, quantitative research, and market surveillance.

## 2. Project Lifecycle & Deliverables-
i Data Acquisition and Preparation:
- Phase:Initial setup and data pipeline development.
- Activity: Utilized the yfinance library to build a robust data ingestion pipeline for downloading historical OHLCV (Open, High, Low, Close, Volume) data. The data was then preprocessed to handle missing values and compute essential financial features, such as returns, volatility, and momentum indicators.
- Deliverable: A functional data pipeline capable of retrieving and preparing market data for analysis.

ii Algorithm Development:
- Phase: Core model implementation and validation.
- Activity: Developed 5 anomaly detection algorithm- Z-Score, Volatility Clustering, Jump-Diffusion, Isolation Forest, and Regime Change Detection 
within the MarketAnomalyDetector class. Each method was implemented based on established financial econometrics and machine learning principles.
- Deliverable: The MarketAnomalyDetector class, containing modular and well-documented functions for each detection method.

iii Visualization and User Interface (UI) Development:
- Phase: Front-end development and result visualization.
- Activity: Designed and built a dynamic and interactive UI using the Streamlit framework. The application allows users to input stock tickers and date ranges, configure detection parameters, and visualize results through interactive plots generated by Plotly.
- Deliverable: A fully functional Streamlit application (market_anomaly_detector.py) that serves as the main interface for the system.

iv Integration and Deployment:
- Phase: Final system integration and testing.
- Activity: Integrated the data pipeline, the detection algorithms, and the Streamlit UI into a single, cohesive application. Conducted end-to-end testing to ensure the system's stability and accuracy, including error handling for invalid inputs or data retrieval issues.
- Deliverable: The complete, unified market_anomaly_detector.py file, ready for local execution or deployment.

## 3. Results & Discussion-
The system successfully identifies and visualizes a range of market anomalies, providing actionable insights.

- Statistical Outliers: The Z-score method effectively pinpoints extreme daily returns, highlighting significant single-day events, often correlated with major news announcements.
- Volatility Clusters: The volatility detection method identifies periods of heightened market turbulence, which are critical for risk management and for signaling potential regime shifts.
- Jump-Diffusion Events: By differentiating between continuous and discontinuous price movements, the jump detection method effectively flags sudden, sharp price movements that cannot be explained by typical market noise. This is particularly valuable for derivatives pricing and high-frequency trading.
- Multivariate Anomalies: The Isolation Forest algorithm proves to be a powerful tool for detecting anomalies that may not be apparent from a single metric. It identifies unusual behavior across multiple indicators (e.g., returns, volatility, and volume), providing a more holistic view of market behavior.
- Regime Changes: The regime change detection method successfully identifies structural breaks in market behavior, which are essential for long-term strategic adjustments and for understanding periods of heightened uncertainty.

The interactive visualizations are a key strength, allowing for a detailed exploration of detected anomalies in the context of price and return charts. The combined insights from these five methodologies provide a comprehensive framework for understanding and reacting to market events.

## 4. Risks-
- Data Quality: The accuracy of the detection algorithms is highly dependent on the quality and availability of historical data. Missing or corrupt data points could lead to false positives or negatives.
- Model Overfitting: For algorithms like Isolation Forest, there is a risk of overfitting to the training data, especially with a small data set. This could lead to a model that performs well on historical data but poorly on new, unseen data.
- Stationarity: Several methods, particularly the Z-score and rolling statistics, assume that the underlying data series is at least locally stationary. While financial returns are generally more stationary than prices, this assumption may be violated during periods of extreme market stress or structural changes.
- Parameter Sensitivity: The performance of the detection algorithms is sensitive to user-defined parameters, such as the statistical threshold, contamination rate, and look-back window. Suboptimal parameter selection could diminish the system's effectiveness.

## 5. Assumptions-
- Financial Market Behavior: The system assumes that financial markets exhibit predictable characteristics, such as volatility clustering and fat tails in return distributions, which are the basis for the chosen methodologies.
- Computational Resources: The Streamlit application assumes that the user has sufficient computational resources to download and process the data, especially for long time ranges or multiple tickers.
- Library Dependencies: The project relies on external libraries (streamlit, pandas, numpy, plotly, scipy, sklearn, yfinance). It is assumed that these libraries are correctly installed in the user's environment.
